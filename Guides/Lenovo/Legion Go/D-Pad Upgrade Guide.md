## Notes
- ⚠️ **By following this guide you take responsibility for your own actions.**  
- The Legion Go doesn’t use threaded inserts. Screws are screwed into plastic and made of cheap metal. Use firm pressure and go slowly.  
- The **main board ribbon cable is very small**. When removing the PCB, unfold it like opening a book. You can leave it attached or flip the clasp to remove it.

## Instructions

1. **Remove the back panel and unplug the battery.**  
2. Remove all 4 screws from the back. Use firm pressure and go slowly.  
3. Separate the two halves of the shell using a pry tool. Refer to the picture for an easy entry spot.  
4. Remove all 4 screws and a rumble pack connector. Be careful, as the screws go into plastic. R2 will come loose.  
5. Pry and pull the right shoulder button off.  
6. **Remove PCB.**  
   - CAUTION: Ribbon cable is tiny.  
   - When removing the PCB, unfold it like opening a book.

7. Remove the controller release button.  
8. Drop your **3D printed D-Pad replacement** into place.  
9. Loosely install the right shoulder button.  
10. Reassemble the device in **reverse order**.
