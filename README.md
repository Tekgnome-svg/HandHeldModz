HandHeldModz Archive & Community

This repository began as an archive of the original HandHeldModz website — a community hub for handheld console modifications, guides, and accessories.
While it preserves the look, feel, and resources of the old site, the project has now been expanded to accept new submissions from the community.

About HandHeldModz

HandHeldModz is dedicated to exploring and showcasing innovative handheld modifications.
Originally, the site featured:

Guides for handheld console modding

Mods & accessories to enhance your devices

Articles by community authors sharing knowledge and projects

A Discord community for collaboration and discussion

That same mission continues here.

GPD

Sony (PlayStation handhelds & PSP/PS Vita)

If your favorite handheld isn’t listed — feel free to create a new category and merge it in. This project grows with the community!

Project Goals

The archive is provided as-is, but community contributions keep it alive and growing

About the Creator

This project is maintained by Tekgnome, the original creator of:

Allymods.com

Handheldmodz.com

Both sites were dedicated to pushing the boundaries of handheld modding — and this GitHub project continues that legacy.

Legacy

Allymods.com – The first site, dedicated specifically to the ASUS ROG Ally. It focused on unlocking the potential of ASUS’s handheld PC through guides, tweaks, and community-driven mods.

HandHeldModz.com – The natural evolution of Allymods, expanding the vision to all handheld brands including MSI, Lenovo, Valve, OneXplayer, Ayaneo, XPG, GPD, Sony, Nintendo, and Anbernic.

This GitHub project now serves as the next chapter — a living archive and an open community space for handheld modders everywhere.
