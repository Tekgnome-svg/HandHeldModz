## Overview

This guide covers how to convert your **Asus ROG Ally (OG)** into a **Nintendo DS–style clamshell handheld** by attaching a secondary display with a custom 3D-printed housing and hinge system.  

The secondary screen folds up and down, giving the Ally a unique dual-screen setup.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Preparing the Screen

1. The screen has **two HDMI ports**: remove the outer port by either desoldering or carefully snipping it off.  
   - Do the same for the **3.5mm aux port** (not needed).  
   - Only keep the ports circled in red (see photo).  

2. Plug the screen into the Ally via the dock using the **HDMI and Micro USB ribbons** to confirm it works.  

3. Adjust the screen brightness using the wheel while connected.  

4. Unplug the screen and remove the **adjustment wheel** (desolder or snip off).

### Part 2: Preparing the Dock

1. Using a pry tool, remove the **plastic casing** around the dock’s ports and wire.  
2. Slide the **board and wire** out of the shell.  
3. Mount the dock to the back of the screen with **mounting tape**.  
4. Route the **HDMI and Micro USB cables** through the housing.  
5. Place the dock + screen assembly into the **3D printed housing**.  
6. Feed the dock wire through the **housing lid hole**.  
7. Glue the dock’s USB-C connector to the wire holder, then glue the wire holder to the lid.  
8. Test by plugging the USB-C into the Ally with the extension.  
   - If working correctly, glue the **back cover** to the housing.

### Part 3: Mounting the Screen to the Ally

1. Thread the **90mm M3 rod** through the housing with a hinge part on either side.  
2. Place **washers** on either side of the hinges to distribute pressure.  
3. On the opposite side of the hinge, use the **hinge support** instead of the housing (see reference photo).  
4. Place the completed screen assembly onto the Ally.  
5. Glue the hinge support to the **back of the Ally** so everything aligns.  
6. Once glue is dry, tighten the **lock nuts** to adjust hinge tension.  
   - The hinge should hold the screen at any desired angle.  

✅ The Ally should now open and close like a **Nintendo DS** with a functional second screen.

## Notes

- This mod is fully **reversible** if you design a new backplate instead of gluing directly.  
- Recommended adhesives: **epoxy** for strength, or **cyanoacrylate superglue** for precision.  
- For stability, you may design **reinforcement brackets** for the hinge supports.
