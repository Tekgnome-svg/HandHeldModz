### Disable Telemetry Collection
While sending usage statistics to Microsoft may help improve services, it also shares anonymized data with third parties. If you’re concerned, follow these steps to turn it off:  

1. Open the **Start menu** and click the **Settings** icon.  
2. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Diagnostics & feedback**.  
3. Expand the **Diagnostic data** section.  
4. Toggle **Send optional diagnostic data** → **Off**.  
5. Scroll down to **Tailored Experiences**, expand the section, and toggle it **Off**.  

This limits Microsoft’s data collection, though some core telemetry cannot be fully disabled in consumer editions of Windows.
