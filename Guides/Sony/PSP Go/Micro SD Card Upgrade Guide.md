# PSP Go – Micro SD Card Upgrade Guide

Since the PSP Go does not have a UMD drive, the internal storage of 16GB may not be enough for most users.  
Adding a micro SD card is a cost-effective way to expand storage, as proprietary memory sticks are expensive.

1. **Remove the back panel screws**  
   - Unscrew the four screws at the back of the PSP Go.  

2. **Remove the top screws**  
   - Unscrew the two top screws. These are a different size, so keep them separate.  

3. **Pop off the back shell**  

4. **Install Micro SD adapter**  
   - Plug the micro SD card into the adapter and insert the adapter into the PSP Go.  

5. **Format the memory stick**  
   - Turn on the PSP Go and navigate to:  
     `Settings -> System Settings -> Format Memory Stick`  
   - Wait for the process to complete.  

6. **Secure the adapter**  
   - Tape down the adapter using Kapton tape or similar, as shown in the reference images.  

7. **Trim back shell if needed**  
   - Remove small plastic pieces from the back shell so the adapter fits.  
   - Use flush cutters or an X-Acto knife for precision.  

8. **Reassemble**  
   - Snap the back shell in place.  
   - Screw in the four shorter screws at the back and the two longer screws at the top.  

✅ The mod is now complete! You can use the micro SD card as if it were a regular mini SD.
