- Plastic pry tool

## Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **By following this guide, you take responsibility for your own actions.**  
- This mod *should not* void your warranty, but always double-check with customer service depending on your region and local laws.  
- The red **"warranty void"** stickers on the battery and heat pipe **do not** void your warranty, provided you restore the device to factory condition before an RMA.  
- Be very careful when removing the **back panel, paddle, and trigger screws**, as they can strip easily!

## Printing the Base
- Post-processing the printed base is **critical**.  
- Small defects in the print can lead to:
  - Poor feedback  
  - False inputs  
  - No inputs  
- For best results:
  - Use a **resin (SLA) printer** for high accuracy.  
  - If using FDM, make sure your printer is very well calibrated.  
  - Apply **slight heat** to the bottom of the metal D-Pad and press it into the printed part for proper clearance.
