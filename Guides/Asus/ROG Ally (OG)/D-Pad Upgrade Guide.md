## Notes

- This shouldn’t void your warranty. You can contact customer service for clarification depending on your country and local laws.  
- The red *“warranty void”* sticker on the battery and heat pipe does **not** void your warranty provided you do not damage anything inside the device and restore it to factory condition before RMA.  
- Be extremely careful when removing back panel screws, paddle screws, and trigger screws as they can strip!

## Instructions

### Printing the Parts
- You will need to print both the **D-Pad** and the **ring file**.  

**For Resin Printing (SLA):**  
- Use: `ROG_Ally_Elite_Magnetic_Dpad_for_resin__v1.stl`  

**For FDM Printing:**  
- Use:  
  - `ROG_Ally_Elite_Magnetic_Dpad_v1.stl`  
  - `ROG_Ally_Elite_Magnetic_Dpad_Pivot_v1.stl`  

- The **ring file** works for both printing methods.  

➡️ It is extremely important to have a **clean, accurate print**.  
Defects will cause poor feedback, false inputs, or no input at all.  
- SLA resin printing is preferred for best accuracy.  
- You can apply slight heat to the bottom of the metal D-Pad and press it into the printed part to improve clearance.  

---

### Magnets
- You can either salvage magnets from the eXtremerate green D-Pad or use your own **6x3x3mm** or **6x3x2mm** magnets.  
- Magnets can be **friction fit** into the printed part.  
- If they are loose, secure with a drop of superglue in each hole.

### Installation

The ROG Ally is one of the easier handhelds to disassemble.  
For a teardown reference, see [iFixit’s teardown video](#).  

1. **Remove the back panel and unplug the battery.**  
2. Remove the 4 screws holding the battery and lift it out.  
3. Remove both joystick boards:  
   - 3 ribbon cables  
   - 4 screws  
4. Unplug speaker cable.  
5. Unplug fan headers, remove fan screws, and remove fans.  
6. Unplug 2 cables from the wireless card.  
7. Unplug the display ribbon cable.  
8. Unplug the speaker connector.  
9. Remove all 12 motherboard screws.  

At this point:  
- You can either **tilt and lift the motherboard** out,  
- Or just tilt it enough to remove the stock D-Pad and slide in the new one.  

➡️ Ensure the **bottom tab is rotated downward** so it aligns correctly when installed.

### Final Steps
- Reassemble the Ally.  
- Place the **printed ring** over the D-Pad from the outside.  
- Secure it with **double-sided tape** along the edges.  

✅ Done! You now have an upgraded magnetic D-Pad for your ROG Ally.
