# Ally Low-Profile / Mod Paddle Installation Guide

This is a quick overview and tutorial on how to install **low-profile or mod paddles** in your ASUS ROG Ally.  
This mod replaces the larger OEM back paddles with slimmer, lower-profile ones.

> Note: Resin parts were designed by Calini during the design phase. They print well with FDM or SLA printers but are finicky due to their small size.

## Materials Needed

- FDM or SLA 3D printer  
- Phillips size #100 driver  
- Plastic pry tool  
- OEM charger  
- [Download the STL files here](https://www.printables.com/model/508952-rog-ally-minimal-back-buttons)

## Notes & Warnings

- Designed by **Calini**.  
- This mod **shouldn’t void your warranty**, but check with customer service for clarification based on your country and laws.  
- The red “warranty void” sticker on the battery and heat pipe **does not void your warranty** if nothing inside is damaged and the device is restored to factory condition.  
- You will need to **self-tap screws** into the printed part:  
  - FDM: heat screws to tap threads.  
  - SLA: tap screws **before curing**.  
- Be **extremely careful** when removing back panel screws and paddle screws — they can strip easily.

## Print Instructions

### FDM Printers

1. Rotate the part **flat against the build plate**.  
2. Use **20% infill** (sufficient for most users).  
3. Print **slowly** with part cooling enabled.  
4. Heat the screw and tap the threads into the part.

### SLA Printers

1. Rotate the part so the **flat side faces the screen**.  
2. Remove excess resin from the screw hole.  
3. Tap the screw **before curing**.  
4. Avoid touching the flat surface before curing for best finish.
