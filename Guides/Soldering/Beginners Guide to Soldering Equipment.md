# General Soldering Guide

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This guide covers the **minimum tools and recommendations** for basic soldering and additional tools required for advanced work, such as **ROG Ally RAM replacement (BGA soldering)**.  
> Always practice on scrap boards before attempting delicate work.

## Overview

This is a comprehensive list of tools and consumables for soldering.  
It is divided into two sections:  
- **Basic Soldering Tools** – enough for small electronics work.  
- **Advanced (BGA Work)** – only required if you plan on replacing RAM chips or doing similar rework.  

All items are chosen based on **best value for quality**.

## Basic Tools & Consumables

- **Tacky Flux**:  
  - Stirri or Inventec tacky flux in syringe form.  
  - The most common is **NC-559-V2-TF**.  
  - ⚠️ Do not skimp on flux. Avoid liquid and rosin-based fluxes for SMD work.  

- **Desoldering Wick**:  
  - Any basic copper solder wick works.  

- **63/37 Leaded Solder**:  
  - Avoid lead-free solder (harder to work with, requires higher temps).  

- **Wipes**:  
  - **Kimwipes** recommended.  
  - Cotton can also work — just use something low-dust that won’t fall apart.  

- **Cleaning Alcohol**:  
  - **Denatured alcohol** or **Isopropyl (≥90%)**.  

- **Needle Nose Tweezers**:  
  - Precision tip tweezers recommended for SMD.  

- **Silicone Mat**:  
  - Heat-resistant work surface. Example: [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Resistant-Electronic-Insulation-Station15-9/dp/B075M7PQZX).

## Soldering Irons

Choose one of these recommended irons (all are USB-C PD powered, digital, and tip-heated):  

- **Pinecil** – best value.  
  - Pick up at least one **fatter tip** for better heat retention.  

- **TS80p** – compact, adequate for most jobs.  
  - Lower wattage, but fine with fatter tips.  

- **TS100/TS101** – higher quality, more expensive.  
  - Essentially similar to Pinecil but more premium.  

⚠️ Unless purchased as a kit, you will also need a **USB-C PD power adapter**.

## Advanced Tools (For BGA Work / Ally RAM Replacement)

Only required if you plan on **replacing RAM or similar rework**:  

- **Hot Air Gun**:  
  - Example: [8858 Hot Air Gun](https://www.amazon.com/LRT-8858-Desoldering-100-500℃-212-932℉/dp/B09VZ9HB37).  
  - ⚠️ Not a high-end tool, but inexpensive and effective if used carefully.

## Notes

- Always use **digital temperature control** soldering irons with **tip-heating elements** (faster heat, better stability).  
- When soldering BGA components, **flux and thermal control** are critical.  
- For beginners, practice with scrap PCBs before touching valuable hardware.  
- If working on handhelds like the **ROG Ally**, disassembly and soldering **will void your warranty**.
