### 2. Enabling Handheld Companion
1. Open **Handheld Companion**.  
2. Handheld Companion must be launched **before any game launcher**, so ensure all game launchers are closed before starting the service.  
3. Go to **Settings** and enable:  
   - Auto-Start  
   - Open application in background  
   - Close minimizes (optional, personal preference)  
4. You can now press the **hotkey** at any time to bring up the Quick Tools window and hide it again.  

‚úÖ Handheld Companion is now enabled with a hotkey function.

### 3. Changing the TDP
1. Go to the **Profiles** section.  
2. Enable **Thermal Power (TDP) limit**.  
3. Set the TDP to your preferred value.  

---

### 4. Remapping the Buttons
1. In the **Profiles** tab (left side panel), scroll down and click **Controller Layout**.  
2. Remap any buttons on your handheld.  
3. You can create & share custom layout templates with others.

### 5. Enabling the Gyro
1. Press the **Quick Tools hotkey** you created earlier.  
2. A menu will appear in the bottom right of your screen.  
   - Use **LB/RB** to move between tabs.  
   - Go to the **third tab** and scroll to **Motion Control Settings**.  
3. Configure your motion control:  
   - **Output device:** Right Stick  
   - **Style of input:** Joystick Camera  
4. Choose motion activation mode:  
   - **Enabled (Turn off with a button):** Gyro is always on unless you hold the hotkey.  
   - **Disabled (Turn on with buttons):** Gyro is only on while holding the hotkey.  

   üëâ Example: I play with **Disabled**, mapped to **Left Trigger**. Holding Left Trigger activates the motion controls.  

5. Adjust dead zone and sensitivity as needed.  
6. Minimize Handheld Companion and launch any game.  
7. Once in-game, press/hold your Gyro hotkey and move your device around to use gyro aiming.
