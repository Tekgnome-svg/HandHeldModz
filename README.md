# HandHeldModz Archive & Community

This repository began as an **archive of the original HandHeldModz website** — a community hub for handheld console modifications, guides, and accessories.  
While it preserves the look, feel, and resources of the old site, the project has now been expanded to accept **new submissions from the community**.
